      I developed the enemies, as well as the zoomer powerup mechanic. The
      enemies included all of those in the first area (Zoomers, Zebs, Reos,
      Skrees, and Rippers). The powerup mechanic essentially allows the player
      to turn into one of the zoomers, enabling them to crawl on walls and
      ceilings. I also developed the player and enemy animations. I used Unity
      with C#.

      A 2D platformer with no jumps. Instead of jumping, players traverse
      levels by toggling magnetic blocks that can either attract or repel the
      player. Later in the game, players unlock the ability to place their own
      magnets, opening up the game for further problem-solving. I developed
      this game solely by myself (using some external assets), over the course
      of 2 weeks.

      I worked on many different aspects of this game. Notably, I worked on
      almost all of the audio in the game including sound effects and music 
      choices. I also added all of the hat options, and personally modeled the
      beard, propeller hat and chef hat. I developed most of the physics behind
      the orders, such as the trail of orders behind the player, the stack of
      orders on top of the player's head, and the orders dropping around the
      player when they are hit by a hazard. I completed the logic for stealing
      orders, ensuring that the others get transferred from one player to
      another. Finally, I completed the second level, "Weiner Way" by myself 
      including the orders following cars mechanic.

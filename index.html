        <li>I developed the enemies, as well as the zoomer powerup mechanic. The enemies included all of those in the first area (Zoomers, Zebs, Reos, Skrees, and Rippers). The powerup mechanic essentially allows the player to turn into one of the zoomers, enabling them to crawl on walls and ceilings. I also developed the player and enemy animations. I used Unity with C#.</li>

        I developed the enemies, as well as the zoomer powerup mechanic. The
        enemies included all of those in the first area (Zoomers, Zebs, Reos,
        Skrees, and Rippers). The powerup mechanic essentially allows the player
        to turn into one of the zoomers, enabling them to crawl on walls and
        ceilings. I also developed the player and enemy animations. I used Unity
        with C#.

        A 2D platformer with no jumps. Instead of jumping, players traverse
        levels by toggling magnetic blocks that can either attract or repel the
        player. Later in the game, players unlock the ability to place their own
        magnets, opening up the game for further problem-solving. I developed
        this game solely by myself (using some external assets), over the course
        of 2 weeks.
